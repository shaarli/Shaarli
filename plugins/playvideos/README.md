### ► Play Videos plugin for Shaarli

Adds a `► Play Videos` button to [Shaarli](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli)'s toolbar. Click this button to play all videos on the page in an overlay HTML5 player. Nice for continuous stream of music, documentaries, talks...

This plugin is currently only compatible with Youtube videos.

#### Installation and setup

This is a default Shaarli plugin, you just have to enable it. See [Shaarli configuration](../../doc/md/Shaarli-configuration.md).


#### Troubleshooting

If your server has [Content Security Policy](https://content-security-policy.com/) headers enabled, this may prevent the script from loading fully. This plugin only requires to accept content from Youtube servers, so simply allow `https://www.youtube.com` as source for `script-src` and `frame-src` in your server settings. Example CSP rule for apache2:

```apache
<Directory /path/to/shaarli>
    # Required for playvideos plugin
    Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; form-action 'self'; script-src 'self' https://www.youtube.com; connect-src 'self'; frame-src 'self' https://www.youtube.com; img-src 'self' data:; style-src 'self'; font-src 'self'"
</Directory>
```

You may place the `Header` directive in the `<Directory...` section of your [webserver configuration](../../doc/md/Server-configuration.md)/virtualhost file, or write the above snippet to `/etc/apache2/conf-available/shaarli-csp.conf`; then run `a2enconf shaarli-csp; service apache2 reload`.
